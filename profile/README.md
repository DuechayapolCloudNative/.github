# Welcome to DuechayapolCloudNative organisation
This is the organisation comprising of all repositories that are used in the Cloud Native Computing project for Masters in Computing in ATU Galway 2025.

There are a total of three main repositories in this organisation, with the first two being used in part of the project:
* `catalog-service` - contains the application code of the project, taken from the labs done throughout the module, but without any GitHub Actions workflow
* `operator-config` - contains configuration files used in deployment and servicing of applications in development and production environments, in ArgoCD. These configurations files do not include manifests in ArgoCD itself.
* `miscellaneous` - contains other code or configurations that are not linked directly to the repository, but are inputs to some mechanics of the project. These include Jenkins' build jobs and ArgoCD manifests, as well as the copy of the report.

Each repository also contains its own README file, containing details of the repository =and how to setup some of the components of the repository.
